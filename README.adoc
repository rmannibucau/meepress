= Meepress, Wordpress on Meecrowave

Meepress runs Wordpress (5) on Apache link:http://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/[Meecrowave]
thanks to Resin link:http://quercus.caucho.com/[Quercus] PHP interpreter.

== How to build

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean install
----

== How to run

Unzip `target/meepress-meecrowave-distribution.zip` and run `bin/meecrowave.sh run`
which is in the `bin` folder of the unzipped folder.

== Configuration

The system property `meepress.filter.redirectedOnIndex` enables to pass
a comma separated value which will force the usage of `index.php` to serve the page.
It is useful when the pattern used for permalinks is not using query parameters (i.e. it uses slugs).
